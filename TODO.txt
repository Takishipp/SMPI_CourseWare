New assignment: Predator/Prey simulation.
    - Topic #3: Make it work
    - Topic #4: Make it fast by adapting the world size, and maybe
      using shadow borders and other technics that I'm not sure about
    - Topic #5: Dynamic Workload Adaptation

New assignment: Something could maybe be built around mass-spring simulations

Topic #4 (Performance):
    - Add asynchronous broadcast to the MM application (once SMPI supports it? or
      have the students implement it by hand?? likely the former option is better)

Topic #5: come up with ideas. Or maybe propose something around Star-PU?
