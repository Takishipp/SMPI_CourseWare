<p class="ui">This topic consists of <b>3 activities, each described in its own tab above,</b> which should be done in sequence.
  It introduces basic but essential concepts for distributed-memory programming, such as:

  <ul class="ui list">
    <li class="ui item"> Single-Program Multiple-Data (SPMD) programming style</li>
    <li class="ui item"> The use of <i>process rank</i> to distribute work among processes</li>
    <li class="ui item"> Local vs. Global indices for 1-D and 2-D data distribution of arrays</li>
    <li class="ui item"> Simple message-passing to coordinate processes</li>
  </ul>

  In this topic we do not focus on performance at all, and we implement a "toy" application that
  computes a Julia set and saves it as a bitmap file for display. Below is (a low-res version of) the
  Julia set we will compute:

    What is a Julia set?

    <p class="ui">A Julia set is a fractal, i.e., an object that is self-similar across scales (you "zoom in"
      and you keep seeing similar structures/features). It is a generalization
        of the famous Mandelbrot set<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set">[Wikipedia]</a></sup>,
      which adorns many T-shirts (search for "Mandelbrot zoom" for psychedelic videos). </p>

      <p class="ui">The particular Julia set
        that we compute here is defined as follows. Given z a point in the 2-D complex plane, we compute the
      series defined as:
      <ul class="ui list">
      <li class="item">z<sub>0</sub> = z</li>
      <li class="item">z<sub>n+1</sub> = z<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> + c</li>
      </ul>
      where c is a chosen complex number. The set in the picture above is for c = -0.79 + i * 0.15. Different
      values of c lead to different pictures, and there are known values that produce "pretty" pictures.
      </p>
      <p class="ui">
      The color of a pixel corresponding to point z is then determined based on the number of iterations
      before the modulus of z<sub>n</sub> is above 2 (or until a maximum number of iterations
      is reached).
    </p>
      <p class="ui">
        Not to worries, code is provided for you for the above. However, feel free to tweak it to create different
        images, or to find out more about Julia sets<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set">[Wikipedia]</a></sup>.
