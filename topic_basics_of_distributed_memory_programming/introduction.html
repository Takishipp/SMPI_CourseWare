  <h3 class="ui header">Overview</h3>

  <p class="ui">This topic introduces basic but essential concepts for distributed-memory programming
    (Single-Program Multiple-Data (SPMD) programming style, the use of <i>process rank</i> to distribute work among processes,
    local vs. Global indices for 1-D and 2-D data distribution of arrays, simple message-passing to coordinate processes).
    The focus is not on performance but on correctness.

    <b>Goal: </b> To implement several versions of a "toy" parallel application that
    computes the Julia set displayed below and saves it as a bitmap file:

  <h3 class="ui header">Roadmap</h3>
  <p class="ui">This topic consists of <b>3 activities, each described in its own tab above, which should be done in
    sequence:</b>
  </p>
  <ul class="ui list">
    <li class="item"><b>Activity #1:</b> Realize a sequential implementation of a program that computes the Julia set
      and
      outputs it to a bmp file.
    </li>
    <li class="item"><b>Activity #2:</b> Realize a parallel implementation the program using MPI, using a 1-D data
      distribution.
    </li>
    <li class="item"><b>Activity #3:</b> Realize a parallel implementation the program using MPI, using a 2-D data
      distribution.

    <div class="item">All source code</div>
    <div class="item">XML platform files (see details in the activities)</div>
    <div class="item">A Makefile with:

        <div class="item">A "default" target that compiles all sources to generate all required executables</div>
        <div class="item">A "run" target that runs all programs (or that displays a message detailing individual targets to run each program) </div>
