    What is a Julia set?

      <p class="ui">A Julia set is a fractal, i.e., an object that is self-similar across scales (you "zoom in"
        and you keep seeing similar structures/features). It is a generalization
        of the famous Mandelbrot set<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set">[Wikipedia]</a></sup>,
        which adorns many T-shirts (search for "Mandelbrot zoom" for psychedelic videos). </p>

      <p class="ui">The particular Julia set
        that we compute here is defined as follows. Given z a point in the 2-D complex plane, we compute the
        series defined as:
      <ul class="ui list">
        <li class="item">z<sub>0</sub> = z</li>
        <li class="item">z<sub>n+1</sub> = z<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> + c</li>
      </ul>
      where c = -0.79 + i * 0.15. Different
      values of c lead to different images, we know many values that produce "pretty" images.
      </p>
      <p class="ui">
        The color of a pixel corresponding to point z is determined based on the number of iterations
        before the modulus of z<sub>n</sub> is above 2 (or until a maximum number of iterations
        is reached).
      </p>
      <p class="ui">
        Not to worry, code is provided for you for the above. However, feel free to tweak it to create different
        images and to find out more about Julia sets<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set">[Wikipedia]</a></sup>.
