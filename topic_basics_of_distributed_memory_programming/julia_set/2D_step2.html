  Augment your program that that each process allocates space to store the pixels it needs to compute, and
  then computes them. As in the previous activity, the main difficulty here is
  keeping local vs. global indexing straight. It is in fact a bit more complex
  than for Activity #2 due to the use of a 2-D date distribution.

<p class="ui">
  Have each process apply a <i>tint</i> to the pixels it handles, by passing
  value <code>rank<sup>2</sup></code> as the 5th argument to
  function <code>compute_julia_pixel()</code> (instead of passing the default
  1.0 value).
