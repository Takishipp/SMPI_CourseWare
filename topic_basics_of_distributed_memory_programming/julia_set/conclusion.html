  <h3 class="ui header">What have we learned?</h3>

  <p class="ui">
    Congratulations for making it this far. At this point you have learned how
    to design a distributed-memory application as an SMPD program using SMPI, have been
    exposed to both 1-D and 2-D data distributions, and have
    learned how to use communication to orchestrate the executions of MPI
    processes.  You may also have learned about memory layouts of 2-D arrays.
  </p>

  <p class="ui">
    Our Julia set computation is a "toy application". Admittedly, our use of
    a 2-D data distribution made the application more complicated to write without
    any clear benefit. We will see other examples for which 2-D data distributions
    provide significant performance advantages.  Also, we handled all file I/O
    "by hand". In practice, MPI provides a set of abstractions and functions to perform parallel
    I/O, called MPI IO, that could be used to achieve better performance on a real
    systems with high-performance parallel file systems.

  <h3 class="ui header">What was difficult?</h3>

  <p class="ui">
    In a README file write a brief "essay" explaining what you found
    surprising/challenging, and what solutions you used to solve
    your difficulties. Are you happy with your implementations? Do you
    see room for improvement?
