Augment your program so that it saves the image to a file called <code>julia.bmp</code>, which stores
the image in the bmp format.
  To make the above easier you are provided with a helper C function, <code>write_bmp_header()</code>, which
  writes to a file the 40-byte header required for a bmp file.
