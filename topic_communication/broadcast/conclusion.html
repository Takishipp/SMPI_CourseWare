  <h3 class="ui header">What have we learned?</h3>

  <p class="ui">
    Congratulations for completing this module. At this point you have learned how
    to use point-to-point MPI communication, both synchronous and asynchronous;
    you have learned about the most common collective communication primitive,
    the broadcast; you have observed first hand the connection between communication
    patterns and the underlying network topology; you have learned how pipelining
    and asynchronous communication can boost communication performance.
  </p>

  <p class="ui">
    As part of our experimental evaluations, you have observed the overall good
    performance of the default <code>MPI_Bcast</code> implementation. It would be very
    enlightening to look at open source MPI implementations and inspect the code
    (although it is intricate) to understand how the broadcast is implemented. In general,
    few developers implement broadcast by hand. However, in some cases (see upcoming modules),
    it can be useful to use a by-hand implementation of a broadcast to achieve better
    performance (in general, better overlap of communication and computation).

  <h3 class="ui header">What was difficult?</h3>

  <p class="ui">
    At the end of your report, write a brief "essay" explaining what you found
    surprising/challenging, and what solutions you used to solve
    your difficulties. Are you happy with your implementations? Do you
    see room for improvement?
