  <h3 class="ui header">Overview</h3>

  <p class="ui">
    <b>Objective: </b> To implement several versions of a broadcast collective (i.e., a one-to-many communication),
    and to compare them in various platform setups.
  </p>

  <h3 class="ui header">Roadmap</h3>
  <p class="ui">This module consists of <b>4 activities, each described in its own tab above, which should be done in
    sequence:</b>
  </p>
  <ul class="ui list">
    <li class="item"><b>Activity #1:</b> Realize a naive and a ring-based implementation.
    </li>
    <li class="item"><b>Activity #2:</b> Enhance the ring-based implementation with pipelining.
    </li>
    <li class="item"><b>Activity #3:</b> Enhance the ring-based implementation further using asynchronous communication.
    </li>
    <li class="item"><b>Activity #4:</b> Implement a binary-tree-based implementation (with pipelining and asynchronous communication).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="ui">In all activities above you will compare your implementation with <code></code>MPI_Bcast</code>, for different platform configurations.</p>

</div>


<div class="ui container segment raised fluid">
  <h3 class="ui header">Skeleton Program</h3>
  <p class="ui">
    Throughout this module, you will be adding code to a "skeleton program" (download <a href="bcast_skeleton.c">bcast_skeleton.c</a>):
  </p>

  <div class="ui accordion fluid">
    <div class=" title">
      <i class="dropdown icon"></i>
      See the source in bcast_skeleton.c ...
    </div>
    <div class=" content">
      <div class="ui raised container segment ">
        {% highlight C %}
        {% include_relative bcast_skeleton.c %}
        {% endhighlight %}
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="ui">
    This program takes the following command-line arguments:
  <div class="ui list bulleted">
    <div class="ui item">required argument #1: a string that is the name of the broadcast implementation (see each activity)</div>
    <div class="ui item">optional argument #2 (<i> [-c chunksize]</i>): an integer that specifies a "chunk size" (see activity #2)</div>
  </div>
  </p>
  <p class="ui">
    <b>You should not modify <code>bcast_skeleton.c</code> outside of the <code>TO IMPLEMENT: BEGIN</code> and
    <code>TO IMPLEMENT: END</code> comments.</b>  See comments therein for all needed information to implement
    your code. Note that you can opt to write your code directly in between these two comments,
    or <code>#include</code> it, up to you.  Regardless, the goal is to have a single program,
    <code>bcast_skeleton</code>, that is executed with different command-line arguments for
    all activities in this module.
  </p>

  <p class="ui">
    The skeleton program does the following for you:  parsing of command-line arguments, creation of broadcast data,
    checksum-based checking that the broadcast operation was done correctly, timing of the broadcast operation. 
  </p>

  <h3 class="ui header">What to turn in</h3>
  <p class="ui">You should turn in a single archive (or a github repo) with:
  <div class="ui bulleted list">
    <div class="item">All source code</div>
    <div class="item">XML platform files (see details in the activities)</div>
    <div class="item">A Makefile that compiles all executables (and has a 'clean' target!)</div>
    <div class="item">A README file with answers to the questions asked in the activities</div>
  </div>
  </p>
