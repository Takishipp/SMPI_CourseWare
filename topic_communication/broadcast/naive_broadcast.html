<p class="ui">
  Augment the <code>bcast_skeleton.c</code> program with a broadcast implementation named
  <b><code>naive_bcast</code></b> (first command-line argument). This implementation simply
  has the root of the broadcast (process with rank 0) perform a single
  point-to-point <code>MPI_Send</code> of the whole buffer to each other process (which performs an <code>MPI_Recv</code>).
  In other words, the processes are logically organized as
  a <i>mono-directional star</i> with process of rank 0 at the center.
  The second command-line argument (chunk size) is ignored.
