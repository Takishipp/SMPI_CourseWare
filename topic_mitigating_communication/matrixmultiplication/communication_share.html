Instrument your code so that at the end of execution, in addition to wallclock time,
  it also reports the time spent in communication (which you measure via additional calls
  to <code>MPI_Wtime</code>). Using p=16 processes, run experiments with the original (i.e., with
  the original network) platform file for N = 8X for X âˆˆ {100,110,120,...,400}, with 5 trials per experiment.
  This runs in about 10 minutes on the author's.
On the same plot show the computation time and the communication time vs. the matrix size.
  What do the trends look like? Do they make sense w.r.t. to some asymptotic models of
  computation and communication volumes?
  Is this good news or bad news for multiplying large matrices on our platform?
