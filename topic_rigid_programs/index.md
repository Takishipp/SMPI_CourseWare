<h3 class="ui header">Overview</h3>

  <p class="ui">This topic focuses on implementation of "rigid" parallel program, i.e.,
     programs in which the data distribution schemes and the communication patterns
     are regular and static. The learning objectives are similar to those in Topic #1,
     but on steroids. The focus is mostly on correctness.
