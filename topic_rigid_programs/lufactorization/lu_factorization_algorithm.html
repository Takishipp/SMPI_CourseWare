  Implement a program called <code>lu</code> (<code>lu.c</code>), that implements the
  Gaussian elimination (without pivoting) algorithm.   You may have covered this algorithm in a course,
  and it is of course well-document in various texts.  Regardless, a sequential implementation,
  <code><a href="./sequential_lu.c">sequential_lu.c</a></code>, is provided. So you can use it as a starting point
  in a "let's parallelize an existing sequential implementation" scenario. The overall algorithm for iteration
  <i>k</i> is:
  <div class="ui bulleted list">
  <div class="ui item"> If I hold column k (global) of the matrix,
    update the column and broadcast it to all other processes.</div>
  <div class="ui item">For all the columns I hold that are after column k, update their lower portion.</div>
</div>
</p>



<p class="ui">
  To make it easy to test your implementation, we compute the LU factorization of a particular
  matrix defined as follows:

<p style="text-align:center;" class="ui">
  <img align="center" src="./lu_matrix.jpg" width="180">
</p>
(note that the indices start at 0).
</p>

<p class="ui">
  The matrix, once the Gaussian Elimination is complete, will have all 1â€™s in its lower triangular portion, 
  and i<sup>2</sup> values on its diagonal and in its upper triangular portion.
  Run <code>lu_sequential.c</code> with a small value of N to see this structure. Your code should check
  that these are the values computed by your implementation (each process can do its own check, and the number of
  errors can be "MPI_Reduced" as the process of rank 0 to print and overall "success" or "failure" message).
</p>

<p class="ui">
  You can use any XML platform file and accompanying hostfile to run your MPI program,
  since this module is solely about correctness and not performance. For instance,
  you can use
  <a href="./cluster_crossbar_64.xml">cluster_crossbar_64.xml</a> as a platform file
  and <a href="./hostfile_64.txt">hostfile_64.txt</a> as a hostfile.
</p>

<p>For debugging purposes, remember that it's a good idea to insert calls to <code>MPI_Barrier</code>
  so that debugging output from the program can be structured step-by-step.
</p>

<p><b>Hints:</b>
<div class="ui list bulleted">
  <div class="ui item"> Use the standard <code>MPI_Bcast()</code> function to perform the broadcasts</div>
  <div class="ui item"> It's a very good idea to implement <code>local2global()</code> and <code>global2local()</code>
    functions that do the translations between local and global indices.</div>
  <div class="ui item"> Recall that sending a column is not very convenient because matrices are traditionally stored
    in row-major fashion in C, thus requiring either the use of an additional buffer or of an MPI data type. Or you
    store your matrix in column-major fashion and do the necessary mental gymnastic to parallelize the row-major
     sequential program... </div>
