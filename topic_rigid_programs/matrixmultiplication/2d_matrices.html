<div class="ui container segment raised">In this activity we distributed the matrices across the MPI processes, which
  entails dealing with local vs. global indexing. As opposed to what was seen in previous topics, we now use a 2-D data distribution,
  which complicates indexing a bit.  We multiply square matrices: <i>A = B x C</i>.
