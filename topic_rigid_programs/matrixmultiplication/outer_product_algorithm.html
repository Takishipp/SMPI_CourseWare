  Implement a program called <code>matmul</code>, which builds on your <code>matmul_init</code>
  program from the previous activity and implements the outer-product matrix multiplication algorithm.
</p>

<p class="ui">
The principle of the outer-product algorithm, as might be expected, is that a matrix multiplication
  can be performed as a sequence of outer-products. You may have covered this algorithm in a course,
  and it is of course well-document in various texts. You may expand below to get a brief description
  of the algorithm.

  <b>Implementing "broadcasts": </b> The algorithm involves broadcasts in process rows and process columns. In MPI, a broadcast
  must involve all processes in a communicator. Thus, one option to implement the
  algorithm is to create 2p communicators, one for each process row and one for each
  process column. <code>MPI_Bcast</code> can then be used for these communicators. Communicators
  can be easily created using the <code>MPI_Comm_split</code> function (see the MPI documentation). The alternative
  is to rely on sequences of point-to-point communications, which isn't as pretty and likely not as efficient.

  <b>Result validation</b>: Recall that we compute a particular matrix product. To validate the result once the outer-product algorithm
  has finished, each process must compute the sum of all the elements in its block of C. These sums are then
  all added up together (using <code>MPI_Reduce</code> is the way to go), and the process of rank 0 prints out
  the sum. This process then computes the difference with the analytical formula:
  <i>N<sup>3</sup> (N - 1)<sup>2</sup> / 2</i>. This process should print out an error message if the
  two values don't match (beware of casts and round-off, you likely want to do everything in double precision
  and check that the absolute value of the difference of the two values is below some small epsilon, instead
  of testing for equality with the '==' operator).

<p>For debugging purposes, remember that it's a good idea to insert calls to <code>MPI_Barrier</code>
  so that debugging output from the program can be structured step-by-step.
