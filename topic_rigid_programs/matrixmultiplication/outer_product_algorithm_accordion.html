    How does the outer-product algorithm work?

      <p class="ui">
        Consider the execution with p<sup>2</sup> processes, where each process is identified
        by 2-D coordinates between 0 and p-1.  For the duration of the algorithm,
        process p<sub>i,j</sub> holds a block of matrix A, a block of matrix B, and a block of
        matrix C, which it computes. The algorithm proceeds in p steps, and at each step each process
        updates its block of matrix C.
      </p>

      <p class="ui">
        Let us refer to the block of matrices A, B, and C held by process p<sub>i,j</sub> as
        A<sub>i,j</sub>, B<sub>i,j</sub>, and C<sub>i,j</sub>. The principle of the algorithm
        is simply stated as:
        <b>
          At step k, each process p<sub>i,j</sub> computes:
          C<sub>i,j</sub> += A<sub>i,k</sub> x B<sub>k,j</sub>.
        </b>
        You can easily verify that this makes sense, meaning that after p steps matrix C
        is equal to AxB.
      </p>

      <p class="ui">
        Because process p<sub>i,j</sub> only holds A<sub>i,j</sub> and B<sub>i,j</sub>, the above
        implies communication. More specifically, at step k:
      <div class="ui list bulleted">
        <div class="ui item"> Each process p<sub>i,k</sub> must broadcast A<sub>i,k</sub> to all processes p<sub>i,*</sub></div>
        <div class="ui item"> Each process p<sub>k,j</sub> must broadcast B<sub>k,j</sub> to all processes p<sub>*,j</sub></div>
      </div>
      </p>

      <p class="ui">
        As a result, at each iteration, each process is involved in 2 broadcasts (either as a sender or as a receiver).
        Blocks of A
        are broadcasted along rows of the process grid, and blocks of B are broadcasted along columns of the process grid. This is
        typically depicted in a figure as follows (recall that block indices are identical to the indices of the processes that hold them). This
        figure is for the second step k=1:

      <p class="ui">
        Given the above, the high-level pseudo-code of the algorithm is straightforward:

      <div class="ui container raised segment">
        <pre>
        // For process p<sub>i,j</sub>
        for k = 0 to p-1
                participate in a broadcast in my process row for block A<sub>i,k</sub>
                  // (I am the source if k==j)
                participate in a broadcast in my process column for block B<sub>k,j</sub>
                  // (I am the source if k==i)
                C += A<sub>i,k</sub> * B<sub>k,j</sub>
        </pre>
      </div>
      </p>
