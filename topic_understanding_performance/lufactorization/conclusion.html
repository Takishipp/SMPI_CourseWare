  <h3 class="ui header">What have we learned?</h3>

  <p class="ui">
    Congratulations for making it this far. You have learned how to measure
    the load imbalance in a
    message passing application, have learned how to implement a cyclic data distribution,
    and have learn how to look at performance results
    and draw conclusions about the scalability of the application, and have
    learned how to use simulation to run large-scale experiments without need for
    a large-scale machine. The performance of the application can be further improve,
    for instance by overlapping communication and computation. In fact, many
    techniques have been developed to improve the performance of this
    particular application.

  <h3 class="ui header">What was difficult?</h3>

  <p class="ui">
    In your README file write a brief "essay" explaining what you found
    surprising/challenging, and what solutions you used to solve
    your difficulties. Are you happy with your implementations? Do you
    see room for improvement?
