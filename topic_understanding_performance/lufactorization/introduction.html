    <b>Objective: </b> To analyze (mostly experimentally) the performance of an implementation
    of the LU factorization algorithm and try to improve it.

  <h3 class="ui header">Prerequisite </h3>

  <p class="ui">
<b>    This module uses the program developed in the LU Factorization module in Topic #3. You must
    have completed that module to do this one. </b>

  <h3 class="ui header">Simulation Calibration</h3>

  <p class="ui">

  To make the simulation results consistent regardless of your computer we first calibrate the simulation.
  More specifically, we simulate a parallel platform in which each processor computes 32 times
  faster than one core of the laptop of the author of this module in 2016.  Calibration of simulated
  compute times with SMPI is straightforward: just pass a particular floating point value to
  <code>smpirun</code> using the <code>--cfg=smpi/running-power:VALUE</code> command-line option.
  In previous modules you may have passed a value of 1.0, meaning that you were simulating a platform in which each processor
  was as fast as one core of your own machine.

  </p>

  <p class="ui">
    A python script called <a href="./calibrate_flops.py"><code>calibrate_flops.py</code></a> is provided, which you should run once
    on your idle computer. This script performs a binary search to find the necessary calibration factor, which is printed
    to the screen and should be passed to the <code>--cfg=smpi/running-power</code> command-line option.
    Of course, if you change computer, you'll have to re-run the script to find a new calibration factor.

  <ul class="ui list">
    <li class="item"><b>Activity #1:</b> Quantify the load imbalance the implementation at large scale.</li>
    <li class="item"><b>Activity #2:</b> Improve the load imbalance.</li>
