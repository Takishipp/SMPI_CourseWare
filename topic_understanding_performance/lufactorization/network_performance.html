  Using your last implementation, i.e., the one that achieves good load balancing, run
  your program for a 32000x32000 matrix, p = 1, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128 processes , using <b>the original</b>
  <a href="cluster_1600.xml"><code>cluster_1600.xml</code></a> platform (with a non-ideal network). Plot the
  parallel efficiency vs. the number of processors.  In your <code>README</code> file describe what you observe.
  What do you conclude in terms of the scalability of your application? Would you say there is work that remains
  to be done? Any ideas?
