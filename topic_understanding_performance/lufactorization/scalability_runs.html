  Now that your simulation is fully calibrated,
  run simulations, using
  <a href=""><code>cluster_1600.xml</code></a>  and
  <a href=""><code>hostfile_1600.txt</code></a>, <b>with p = 1 and p=32 processors</b>,
  using matrices of increasing sizes up to as large as you can run them on your machine (in terms of memory and time), with 5 trials.
  It may be a good idea to do a quick back-of-the-envelope memory footprint calculation to make sure you donâ€™t exceed your RAM.

  Plot an average efficiency vs. matrix size curve.
  What do you conclude in terms of the performance of the application? Are we in good shape if matrices are large or
  is efficiency poor?  You should see it's pretty poor. In the next activity we'll try to fix it!
