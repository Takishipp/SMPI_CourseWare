  Besides cpu time, another limiting factor for scalable simulation is memory space. If
  I want to use SMPI to simulate 100 processes that each uses 1GiB of heap space,
  then I need a single machine with 100GiB of RAM! Again, this sounds bad, which is why
  SMPI allows simulated processes to use the same heap allocations!! This leads to
  nonsensical computation since processes overwrite each other's updates in the same
  allocated memory zones. But, for deterministic application such as matrix multiply,
  overall performance behavior is sufficiently preserved to lead to sufficiently accurate
  simulation results (again, see SMPI research papers and those referenced therein).

  The above is straightforward with SMPI:
  <div class="ui bulleted list">
    <div class="ui item">Replace <code>malloc</code> by <code>SMPI_SHARED_MALLOC</code>;</div>
    <div class="ui item">Replace <code>free</code> by <code>SMPI_SHARED_FREE</code>.</div>
  </div>

  Do the above in your program. You now have a program that computes
  nothing useful at all, but still outputs a simulated wallclock time that research shows
  is sufficiently accurate to draw meaningful conclusions for our purpose!
  The point is that this program can be executed faster and for larger matrices.
  We now have an interesting simulation performance trade-off. With a lot of processes, we can scale the memory up.
  For instance, say the memory space needed for the (sequential) matrix multiplication is 100GiB.
  You canâ€™t run the simulation of this computation on your laptop. However, if you simulate a parallel
  execution with 100 processes, the above memory trick makes it so that you only need 1GiB of RAM to run the simulation.
  However, with a lot of processes, the time to simulate the broadcasts with large data sizes is large
  (due to the sheer number of individual point-to-point messages).
  So, some simulations will take too much space, and some simulations will take too much time.
  Nevertheless, our CPU and memory simulation "tricks" significantly widens the range of simulation experiments
  that can be done in practice.
