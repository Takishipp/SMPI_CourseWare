  <h3 class="ui header">What have we learned?</h3>

  <p class="ui">
    Congratulations for making it this far. You have learned how to measure
    the computation and the communication performance shares of a
    message passing application, have learn how to look at performance results
    and draw conclusions about the scalability of the application, and have
    learned how to use simulation to run large-scale experiments without need for
    a large-scale machine.

  <h3 class="ui header">What was difficult?</h3>

  <p class="ui">
    In your README file write a brief "essay" explaining what you found
    surprising/challenging, and what solutions you used to solve
    your difficulties. Are you happy with your implementations? Do you
    see room for improvement?
