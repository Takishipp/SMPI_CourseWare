  Now that your simulation is fully calibrated,
  run simulations, using
  <a href="./cluster_1600.xml"><code>cluster_1600.xml</code></a>  and
  <a href="./hostfile_1600.txt"><code>hostfile_1600.txt</code></a>, <b>with p=100 processors</b>,
  using matrices of increasing sizes up to as large as you can run them on your machine (in terms of memory and time), with 5 trials
  per matrix size.
  It may be a good idea to do a quick back-of-the-envelope memory footprint calculation to make sure you donâ€™t exceed your RAM.

  Plot an average efficiency vs. matrix size curve. To compute the efficiency, you can simply compute what
  the (simulated) sequential time would be as: N<sup>3</sup> x FLOP CALIBRATION FACTOR / 10<sup>10</sup>.
  What do you conclude in terms of the scalability of the application? Are we in good shape if matrices are large?
